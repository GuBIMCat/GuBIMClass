# GuBIMClass
Classification system of construction elements according to their main function within a BIM environment.
# Scope
It considers the construction elements within the construction field (equipment, infrastructure and installations)
# Background and creation
The objective has been to obtain a classification system that meets the needs of the AEC sector in Spain. The work was based on something existing in the local environment with the aim of evolving it and making it a useful tool for the sector.
The Catalan BIM User Group decided in its meetings to start with the classification used until 2016 by Infraestructures.cat (Generalitat de Catalunya)
Previously, the different most used international classification systems were analyzed for months, reaching the conclusion that an adaptation was needed.
Consequently, its creation has focused on a new common classification system that meets the local requirements of our territory, as well as its future promotion in the sector. It has been given the maximum consensus and usability between the different BIM user profiles, but without losing the alignment with the local idiosyncrasy from which the initial system started.
# Principles
- Function criterion as a guarantee of traceability throughout the life cycle, regardless of uses or phases.
- Homogeneity throughout the system.
- Common language as a means of improving communication.
# Will
From GuBIMCat we intend to play an active role, so that the classification system can continue to be validated and analyzed periodically, publishing future revisions, in accordance with the use that is being given to the territory as a whole.
This work wants to become the guideline for a future expansion and/or unification that encompasses all building projects, civil works, linear works, etc.

# Acknowledgments
We want to highlight the volunteering dimension on which the user group is based. Their involvement and continued drive have been essential for the achievement of this objective, as well as the shows of support and good reception on the part of the rest of the members of the group, of different organizations in the sector and of the BIM community in general.
